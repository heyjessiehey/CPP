1)	Why does the copy assignment operator check for self-assignment before doing anything else?


	The purpose of the copy assignment operatore is that copying data from an existing object to an exsiting object.
	If both object has exactly same data, there is no meaning to keep doing the process of the copy assignment operator.
	Because they already have same data.  
 

2)	List how you avoided duplication of code.



	1. create functions that is frequent usable code
	2. localize the logic of copy operator and the copy assignment operator which have similar task 


3)	List what you have learned in completing this workshop.

	1. create an copy constructor and an assignment operator and localize them.
	2. create an binary operators
	2. create functions avoiding duplication
	3. practice cout.width() and cout.fill()
	4. practice dynamic memory allocation and delocation.






Reflection, Q1: if you do not check for self assignment the application would crash or have undefined behaviour. Can you explain why?
